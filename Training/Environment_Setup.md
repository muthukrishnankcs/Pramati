# Development Environment Setup
## Packages Required for Data Science
### Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text, and it is used for data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.
### Ipython
IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, and it provides a browser-based notebook interface with support for code, text, mathematical expressions, inline plots and other media.
### NumPy
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects, and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.
### SciPy
SciPy is a free and open-source Python library used for scientific computing and technical computing. SciPy contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, ODE solvers and other tasks common in science and engineering.
### pandas
pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
### Scikit-learn
Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It, features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms and it is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy. 
## Setting Up the Environment
- Install python using sudo apt-get install python3.6 command.
- install the following packages using pip install command:
- - numpy
- - scipy
- - pandas
- - sklearn
- - ipython
- - jupyter
- Start the Jupyter Notebook by entering 'jupyter notebook' in the console.
